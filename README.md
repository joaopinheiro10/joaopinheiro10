### Hi !

<p>I am a sports enthusiast, and so that love lead me to get a job as a Sports Analyst.<br>
As time went by, another passion was growing: programming.<br>
So I started my journey following that passion.<br></p>
<br>

<p>Programming is fun, challenging, sometimes mind-blowing and chaotic. That’s where my super skills come into play. I am calm, thrive under pressure, always looking for new challenges and new skills to learn. When developing there are always new challenges coming, which is incredible!</p>
<br>
<p>I’m looking forward to what comes next.</p>
